* Notes on my solutions

** TODO Day 1
I am working with buffers and more imperative features of lisp and so this feels very non-functional way of programming. I have not done that in a while and it feels very weird. The first part is working correctly but my second part seems to give the wrong answer. I don't understand which part I am missing.
#+begin_src elisp :exports both
  (load-file "src/day1.el")
  (count-par (read-line "inputs/day1"))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 74

** Day 2
Reading lines and working with strings is still the hardest part of the problem for me. I somehow read each dimension string as a lisp symbol and worked it from there.
#+begin_src elisp :exports both
  (load-file "src/file-utils.el")
  (load-file "src/day2.el")
  (let ((ls (read-lines "inputs/day2")))
    (values (total ls 'req-area) 
	    (total ls 'ribbon-length)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
| 1588178 | 3783758 |
